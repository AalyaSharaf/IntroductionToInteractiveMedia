### September 10 2020

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- **Connect to Zoom 10 minutes early**
	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- You may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time

**Processing**

#### Simple shapes

- `ellipse()`
- `rect()`
- `size()`
- `triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)`
- `line()`
- `point()`

What does this all mean?
- Functions
- Arguments or parameters

Controlling color, fill, and stroke

- `color()`
- `stroke()`
- `noStroke()`
- `fill()`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, 180)`
- `arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, PI, CHORD)`
- `random()`

Confused? 
- Google
- Processing reference page

#### Variables
- `int myNumber = 45;`
- `int myRandomNumber = random(255);`
- `int myRandomNumber = round(random(255));`
- Other variable types. `int` is by far most common, another common is `float`
- Built-in variables
	- `width`, `height`
	- many others

Here is an example Processing program (also called a 'sketch') 

````
size(400, 400);
ellipse(width/2, height/2, 50, 50);

/*
stroke(0,255,0);
fill(255,0,0);
//ellipse(100,100, 50, 50);

fill(255,0,0, 30);
//rect(30, 30, 50, 80);


// Now I will try to draw an arc
//arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, radians(180), CHORD);

// pick a random number up to 180
float myRandomArcSize = random(180);
int arcSizeAsInt = round (myRandomArcSize);
println(myRandomArcSize + "   " + arcSizeAsInt);

// convert that number to radians
float arcSizeInRadians = radians(myRandomArcSize);

print(myRandomArcSize + "    " + arcSizeInRadians);

// draw the arc
arc(100, 100, 100, 100, 0, arcSizeInRadians, CHORD);
*/
````


Time permitting, go further
	
#### Animation
- `draw()`
- `setup()`

````
int foo = 0;

void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
}

void draw() {
  ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  foo = foo + 1;
}
````

`background()`

`frameRate()`

Yesterday we were able to draw without using `setup()` and `draw()`. What's
the difference?

Static vs. active mode

#### Interaction with Processing

- conditionals

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed == true) {
    background(color(0, 0, 255));
  } else {
    background(color(200, 0, 0));
  }
}
````

**Important concepts**:
1. `mousePressed` is another built-in variable. There are many others.
1. `mousePressed` is a new type of data, namely a `boolean`, which means it has
	 only one of two values, `true` or `false`
1. Note that `{` and `}` indicate the blocks
1. The `else` part of an `if()` statement is optional (what happens if we
	 remove it?)

- Two more interesting built-in variables: `mouseX`, `mouseY`
	- Using the cursor to draw
	- Now use a mouse click to clear the screen
	- (Time permitting, primitive painting program)

#### Loops
`while()` is like `if()` but it keeps on doing it as long as condition is true

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  int foo = 50;

  while (foo < width) {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
    foo = foo + 50;
  }
}
````
You should get in the habit of giving meaningful names to your variables. What
is a better name for the variable foo?

### September 15 2020

#### Administration

- **Record Zoom!**
- **Connect to Zoom 10 minutes early**
	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- Once connected you may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time

#### Portraits

Look at some portraits. Ask if you want to know how something was
accomplished.

#### Review

- ````setup()```` and ````draw()````
- ````background()````
- Conditional statements using ````if()````
- Loops using ````while()````

#### ````for()```` loops

````for```` is very similar to ````while()```` but combines three steps in
one:

````
void setup() {
  size(300, 300);

  for (int foo = 50;foo < width; foo = foo + 50) {
    ellipse(foo, 50, 40, 40);
  }
}
````

	- This is to make sure you have time to fix any potential Zoom issues
	- Once connected you may keep your camera and mic turned off until class time
- **Record Zoom!**
- Discussion leading rubric
	- Review instructions for [student-led
		discussion](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/IntroductionToInteractiveMedia/blob/master/syllabus.md#student-led-discussions)

#### Functions

Every time you use one of the built-in 'commands', you are really using (or
more properly 'calling') a built-in function. Functions are a very important
building block of programming, and in addition to using built-in functions,
you can also create your own. In fact, you've already been doing that, when
you created the `setup()` and `draw()` functions. In the case of
`setup()` and `draw()` you have to use those names, but when you create other
functions you can make up your own names. Just like variables names , good 
function names make your programs easier to understand.

Why create your own funtions?

- Reuse
- Clarity (remember the three reasons for clarity: yourself, sharing,
	grading)
- Easier to debug (what is debugging?)
	- One of the most powerful ways to approach
	a bug is to reproduce it with simplest possible example. 
	This is much easier when the thing that's causing
	the problem is already a function.
- Modularity
- Flexibility (with good choice of parameters)

Review basics of functions from last week

#### Variable Scope

````
int foo;  // this is a global variable, visible in all functions
void setup() {
  foo = 7;
}

void draw() {

  println(foo);

  int bar; // this is a local variable, visible only inside of draw()

  for (int i = 0; i < width/2; i++) { 
    // i is a local variable visible only inside this for() loop
    ellipse(i, height/2, 10,15);
  }
}
````

In class exercise:

1. Write a function that will take a single parameter
and draw a vertical line from the top of the canvas to the bottom
at the X coordinate incidated by the parameter
	1. In the ````draw()```` function test this function 
	at a couple of different locations
1. Write another function that will draw a **horizontal** line
at the indicated **Y** coordinate
	1. Test as before
1. Using these two functions, write a program in ````draw()````
that draws a grid of lines at regular intervals on the canvas

Discussion:

- What debugging methods helped you find and fix problems?
- What other functions might be useful?
- What other parameters might be useful?

````
void setup() { 
  size(500, 500); 
  background(255);
} 

void draw() { 
  vlineMaker(0, 50); 
  hlineMaker(0, 50);
} 

void vlineMaker(int x, int xstep) { 
  while (x<width) { 
    line(x, 0, x, height); 
    x = x+xstep;
  }
} 

void hlineMaker(int y, int ystep) { 
  while (y<height) { 
    line(0, y, width, y); 
    y = y+ystep;
  }
}
````

#### Motion

Let's use make a ball bounce on the floor. First, make a circle move:

<pre>void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
  x = width/2;
} 

float speed = 5;
float x;
float y = 0;

void draw() {
  background(150);

  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;
}
</pre>

Now, make it change directions when it hits the floor:

<pre>void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
  x = width/2;
} 

float speed = 5;
float x;
float y = 0;

void draw() {
  background(150);

  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;

  if (y>=height) {
    speed = -speed;
  }
}
</pre>

Now, do two thing: 1) use gravity to increase its speed as it falls and 2) reduce its speed on each bounce:

<pre>

float gravity = .1;
float speed = 0;
float x = 320;
float y = 0;

void setup() 
{ 
  size(500, 500);
} 

void draw() {
  background(150);
  ellipse(x, y, 20, 20);

  y+=speed;

  speed+=gravity;

  if (y>=height) {
    speed = 0.95 * speed; // this slows the acceleration
    speed = -speed; // this reverses
  }
}
</pre>

Discussion:

- What functions might be useful here?
- How can we use the ````random()```` function to make things more interesting?
- What about multiple bouncing balls?
