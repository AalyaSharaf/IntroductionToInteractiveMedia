#### Assignments Due day 2 June 1

Email Assignment:

Reading Assignment:

- Read [Getting Started with
	Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted)
- Read [Coordinate systems and
	space](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing)
- Read [A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/), and be prepared
	to discuss.

Production Assignment:

- Make a self portrait using Processing.
	- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
	- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 
	- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice
	using the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named `June1`
	- Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension `.pde`. Your
program should be well commented and organized. If you use any variables,
chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a `README.md` in the new folder and include your screenshot in 
	the `README.md`.
	- Write a very simple description of any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.
