#### Assignments Due day 2 June 1

Email Assignment:

- Email me a link to your github repository

Reading Assignment:

- Read [Getting Started with
	Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted)
- Read [Coordinate systems and
	space](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing)
- Read [A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/), and be prepared
	to discuss.

Production Assignment:

- Make a self portrait using Processing.
	- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
	- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 
	- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice
	using the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named `June1`
	- Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension `.pde`. Your
program should be well commented and organized. If you use any variables,
chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a `README.md` in the new folder and include your screenshot in 
	the `README.md`.
	- Write a very simple description of any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.

#### Assignments Due day 3 June 2

Reading Assignment:

- Read for tomorrow's [discussion ](studentLeadDiscussionSchedule.md)


Production Assignment:

- Using loops (`for()` or `while()`) in some way, 
along with everything that you've learned so far, 
make a simple work of art. 
You may want to look at these old computer art magazines for inspiration, 
but you don't need to make your so elaborate. 
Scroll through and look for images:
