Production Assignment:
- Make a self portrait using Processing.
The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 


In your Github repository, create a new folder named June 1
Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension .pde
Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
Create a README.md in the new folder and include your screenshot in that
