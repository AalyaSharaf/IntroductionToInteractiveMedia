[Today's assignment](#todays-assignment)


#### Assignments Due day 2 June 1

Email Assignment:

- Email me a link to your github repository

Reading Assignment:

- Read [Getting Started with
	Processing](https://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted)
- Read [Coordinate systems and
	space](https://processing.org/tutorials/drawing)
- Read [A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/), and be prepared
	to discuss.

Production Assignment:

- Make a self portrait using Processing.
	- The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
	- The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it) 
	- The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice
	using the simple drawing functions.
- In your Github repository, create a new folder named ````June1````
	- Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension ````.pde````. Your
program should be well commented and organized. If you use any variables,
chose good names.
	- Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
	- Create a ````README.md```` in the new folder and include your screenshot in 
	the ````README.md````.
	- Write a very simple description of any difficulties you had or anything
interesting you discovered.

#### Assignments Due day 3 June 2

Reading Assignment:

- Read for tomorrow's [discussion ](studentLeadDiscussionSchedule.md)


Production Assignment:

- Using loops (````for()```` or ````while()````) in some way, 
along with everything that you've learned so far, 
make a simple work of art. 
You may want to look at these old computer art magazines for inspiration, 
but you don't need to make your so elaborate. 
Scroll through and look for images:

#### Assignments Due day 9 June 14

Reading Assignment:

- Readings for the class [discussion ](studentLeadDiscussionSchedule.md).
	Remember that we have two discussions: Loan and Sadeq
- Sparkfun [breadboard
	tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all)
- [Microcontrollers, the basics](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers/microcontrollers-the-basics/)
- [Digital Input & Output](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/lessons/microcontrollers/digital-input-output/)

Production Assignment:

- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have your kits ready to use in class
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). If you are on Windows chose
	the Windows Installer.
- In your kit is a bundle of jumper wires with a very tight ziptie 
	that must be carefully removed. Please do this before class because 
	it may take you a while to find the right tool. 
	A sharp pair of scissors should work. A knife might damage the wires 
	and hurt you.

- **Be careful not to damage the wires or yourselves!**


#### Assignments Due day 10 June 15

	- A description of your concept and how it was achieved
	- A picture of your circuit schematic.  
		- Your schematic, whether hand drawn or otherwise, must be clear. 
		- **Remember what a schematic is and is not.**
		- **Make sure your schematic is big enough to read without enlarging**
	- A photograph of your project
	- Problems, if any, and solutions, if any
	- Anything else you can think of
- Upload your program. 
	- Excellent names for variables and functions
	- Well structured

	are links to various other explanations of the same thing. Browse them, and
	read one deeply enough that you understand. Come to class with questions if
	none of these help.

Production Assignment:

- Make a musical instrument
	- You must use at least one digital sensor (switch)
	- You must use at least one analog sensor (photoresistor, potentiometer, or
