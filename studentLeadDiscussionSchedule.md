Instructions to leader:

1. You have 15 minutes. Allow 3-5 mintes at the end to wrap up, so divide the
   remaining 12-15 minutes into your questions or topics (say 2-5 minutes each)
   and move on to the next question or topic even if there are still hands
   raised

Instructions to everyone else:

1. Don't repeat what someone has already said

1. Don't just say that you liked or disliked the reading. Offer critical
   insight. Why did you like or dislike it? What does it connect to?

1. Did it change your mind about something?
